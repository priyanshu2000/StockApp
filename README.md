# StockApp
This is a simple app that helps users track their favorite stocks. This is not a real time watchlist. You will need to get your own API keys. They're all free. To get started, [follow these instructions](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
after getting your own API key add that Key to '.env.development' file and you're good to go.

## How to run the Project
Before moving further i want you to know that this application is completely developed on a Linux machine and i didn't got the full access of Ios codebase to do configurations so there's chances that the IOS build might going to break so please try running Android build.

Also if you're running a react-native project for the very first time on your machine then please do checkout these [offical docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

#### Make sure you have most recent versions of the Node package and Yarn package manager.

* open your terminal and run the below command to install the required dependencies

> yarn or yarn install

> yarn start

* then open a second terminal and run below command to run the debug bhuid/apk on your emulator or physcial device
